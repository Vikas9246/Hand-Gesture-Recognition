Run Handrec.py for Hand gesture recognition.

- Press 'b' to capture background __( Make sure nothing is there in the area outlined by blue line)__
- Press 'r' to reset the background
- Press 'n' to start the key mapping

I have only mapped 'w' 's' 'a' and 'd' keys on the keyboard to finger count(cnt) 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 or 5 respectively, keys other than these can also  be mapped similarly using PyAutoGUI.For mac users if PyAutoGUI doesn't work they can use appscript instead.

To know more the project and its application follow @saksham36/AutismRehab and @adityaa30 on githhub.
