# Hand gesture recognition using Python and OpenCV

Run Handrec.py for Hand gesture recognition.

- Press 'b' to capture background __( Make sure nothing is there in the area outlined by blue line)__
- Press 'r' to reset the background
- Press 's' to start the key mapping

For now I have only mapped " " (space key) on the keyboard, more keys can be mapped using PyAutoGUI.For mac users if PyAutoGUI doesn't work they can use appscript instead.

To know more the project and its application follow @saksham36/AutismRehab
